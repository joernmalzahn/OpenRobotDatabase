# Open Robot Database (ORD)

The Open Robot Database - short "ORD" essentially is a collection of yaml files listing properties of robots that you typially find in robot datasheets. The original motivation behind this project was to compare different robots to each other and get a picture on what the robots that I can buy would allow me to do in terms of payload capacity, maximum reachability, Cartesian velocity or repeatability.

## Call for Contributions

Keeping the database up-to-date is hard and time consuming work. Any support, contribution and help is grately appreciated and of course credited.

Even if you don't feel to have enough knowldege about GitHub, pushes, commits, pull requests, YAML and databases, programming or open source in general, **you can still contribute** and be part of creating something great! While this holds for any open source project, **the Open Robot Database in particular will benefit from**:

- sharing the knowledge about the existence of the Open Robot Database mouth-to-mouth or on social networks
- notifications about new robots to add
- new robot data
- corrections of erroneous data
- providers of missing data
- feedback on how to improve the database
- some visualisations of the data
- participate in the discussion and provide some hints for listed [issues](https://github.com/joernmalzahn/OpenRobotDatabase/issues)

If you are comfortable with GitHub and can carve out some time to support this project, please feel free to create a pull request with additions, corrections, suggested modifications. If you are a **first time user**, you can drop a message using GitHub issues. Quickly learn about issues with a quick read of the [corresponding section](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) in the GitHub documentation or [watch this short video](https://youtu.be/WMykv2ZMyEQ).

Looking forward and thanks a lot in advance!
